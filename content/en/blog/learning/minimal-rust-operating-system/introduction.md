## What am I doing?
I am going through the [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
guides created by Phil Oppermann.

I am hosting the source code in this [repo](https://github.com/Cal-lifornia/my_minimal_rust_os).
For each part of the original guide I will create an article on what I did and any notable changes or thoughts in regards to what was originally done, I will
also create a git branch to save what I had done for each part of the guide.

## Why am I doing this?
I want to learn lower level systems programming and I want to learn it through Rust as I am an interested in learning the capapilities of the language and
if I want to switch to C/C++ it will be easier learning the fundamentals through Rust first.

## What has been setup before starting the tutorial.
- Created the initial Rust barebones project.
- Since I use the Nix package manager I have created a Flake.nix that I will use with [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) to control
my developer environments
- I have created the repository on Github [here](https://github.com/Cal-lifornia/my_minimal_rust_os) and committed all the current changes to it.

## Next
Now I can start with the guide and will leave any updates on further pages.
