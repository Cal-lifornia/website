About Me
{{% /blocks/lead %}}
# Who I am
Hello, my name is William Hobson and I am currently a Desktop Support Engineer at Flying Bark Productions in Sydney, Australia.
I am an incredibly avid learner and outside of work I apply myself to learn more about software development in hopes of one day working as
a software engineer in some capacity.

## What I do at my job
For work my day to day duties are to assist the artists and others who work for FB with most hardware, software and general admin related issues.
I also work to update any workflows for my team as well as search for new solutions that can improve how we work, this can include setting up
a new Windows machine OS imaging workflow like MDT to make the process of setting up a machine a lot faster, or developing a Terminal UI app to create
easy Windows deployment packages in Salt Stack.

I work closely with the Pipeline and Systems Engineering teams to ensure best working circumstances and iron out any possible issues that artists have
flagged.

## What I do outside of my job
Outside of my work when I'm not chilling out I like to do self learning whether that's programming something or doing research on something I am interested in.

My primary interest is low level programming with Rust like 3D rendering, OS and embedded programming. I have a great love of mathematics so rendering
has always been very interesting to me for that reason, along with the idea of creating an efficient Voxel renderer like the one used in Teardown.
For OS and embedded programming I love creating highly efficient tooling and something that can be used anywhere, I also love the open source
community so learning more about Linux and what can be done is always ideal.

I am also very interested in creating projects with Golang and through creating with Go I have learnt more about video streaming, REST APIs and
various other web technologies.

I primarily program on a Unix system whether that's the NixOS system that I have dual booted on my computer, my Mac or the NixOS WSL distro.
